# Common Command Line Commands in Ubuntu Linux

> **``pwd``**

**Print working directory** This is helpful to list the full path to your current working directory. Most people are familiar with graphical program managers (folder icons/pictures and their respective files). A directory in the command line is similar to what a folder is in the graphical program managers. A current working directory lists all the folders opened to access the current folder you have open.

> **``cd``** 

**Change directory** Opens another directory. If your current working directory is /home/jeff and you would like to change to /home/jeff/Documents, typing: **``cd /home/jeff/Documents``** will open the Documents folder. A faster way to accomplish this is to type **``cd Documents``** 

>**ls**

**List files/folders** This will list the files and directories inside a current working directory. Helpful if you want to **``cd``** (change) to another directory. For example if there are two directories named **``word_docs``** and **``text_files``** inside the **``Documents``** directory, and you are currently at **``/home/jeff/Documents``** the **``ls``** command will list **``word_docs``** and **``text_files``**

>**``cd``** 

**Change to your ``/home/user`` directory**`` 

If you are at **``/home/jeff/Documents/word_docs``** 

**``cd``** will change you to **``home/jeff``**


>**``cd ..``** 

**Change to the directory upstream.**  If you are at **``/home/jeff/Documents/word_docs``** 

**``cd ..``** will change you to **``/home/Jeff/Documents``**


>**``rm -rf "filename"``**
**Removes/deletes the filename listed** (type the filename without the quotes).You must be in the directory of the file you wish to delete or you can type the full path.
