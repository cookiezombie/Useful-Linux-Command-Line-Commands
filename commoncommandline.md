# Common Command Line Commands

> **``pwd``**

**Print working directory** This is helpful to list the full path to your current working directory. Most people are familiar with graphical program managers (folder icons/pictures and their respective files). A directory in the command line is similar to what a folder is in the graphical program managers. A current working directory lists all the folders opened to access the current folder you have open.

> **``cd``** 

**Change directory** Opens another directory. Example: if your current working directory is /home/jeff and you would like to change to /home/jeff/Documents, typing: **``cd /home/jeff/Documents``** will open the Documents folder. A faster way to accomplish this is to type **``cd Documents``** Typing ``cd /Documents`` will not work. If you want to type the **``/``** character you will need to include the full path name **``cd /home/jeff/Documents``** Alternatively, if you know there is a directory named **``word``** inside the **``Documents``** directory **and** you are currently at /home/jeff, you can use the **``/``** character by typing **``cd "FullPathName"``** (without the quotes) or as a shortcut **``cd Documents/word``**

>**ls**

**List files/folders**

This will list the files and directories inside a current working directory. Helpful if you want to cd (change) to another directory. For example if your current working directory home/jeff/
cd ) Change to your home directory. (J home/jeff)?)
(cd ../) Change to upstream? Directory. If you are at home/jeff/Documents (cd ../) will change you to home/Jeff
(How to update your packages and receive security updates) If you're using Ubuntu, Ubuntu will automatically download security updates (not sure about non-security package updates). (sudo apt-get update) followed by (sudo apt-get upgrade). Any command that begins with sudo apt-get can be shortened to sudo apt if you're using Ubuntu 16 or later. You can think of the (sudo apt-get update) as updating the list of pending package/security updates and the (sudo apt-get) as actually installing the updates. Linux will ask you to type Y to confirm the updates. 
(rm -rf (filename)) Deletes file name. You must be in the directory of the file you wish to delete or you can type the full path if you're not in that fileâ€™s directory. 
(dpkg -l) List all your packages. Helpful to get the exact package name if you want to delete a package.
((exact package name) autoremove --purge) The --purge part of the command is optional. If you include the purge it will remove the package as well as dependencies not required by any other program/packages)
